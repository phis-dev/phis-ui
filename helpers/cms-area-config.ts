/**
 * The two halves of an Area preset config, expressed as a path rather than as a list of field names.
 *
 * An Area is edited from two workspaces that own different things: its structure on `/builder/shells`,
 * its Module selection on `/builder/modules`. Which one may write a given value used to be a convention
 * kept by the client and a comment in the server's publish merge; naming the halves makes it a path,
 * and the write routes reject a payload that carries the other one.
 *
 * A Shell Background is not in here, and that is not an oversight: it belongs to a Region and travels
 * in the structure tree. What lives under `shell` is what the Shell states about itself rather than
 * about one of its Regions -- the root route of the Area first.
