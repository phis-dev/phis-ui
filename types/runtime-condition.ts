 * Site was configured to have -- a named fact a Module publishes about its own setup, such as whether a
 * sign-in method is switched on, settled before anything renders and never seen by the browser. `page`
 * is the one the visitor arrived with --
 * the address of the page they opened, which is state as much as any of the others and the only kind
 * that is already settled before the first Widget renders. A confirmation link carries its token there,
 * an external login returns with its outcome there, and a Widget that should appear only for one of
 * those can say so without a component of its own to read the query string.
